<P>
Becoming a supporter of Aerolith.org helps to pay for the server and incites the developer(s) to make more fun products! You will also get several benefits; this list will increase as we add more features:</P>
    <ul>
        <li>Remove limit for number of saved alphagrams among your saved lists (WordWalls game)</li>
    </ul>

<P>
The membership cost is $19.99 per year.</P>

<P>Alternatively, you can contribute in another way. If you know how to code in Python and/or Javascript, you can clone my Aerolith repo from <a href="https://github.com/domino14/Webolith">Github</a> and contribute code! There are a lot of ideas/feature requests that wouldn't take too long to code, but there's so many that I may not be able to do them all in a reasonable timeframe. You can make the change, test it on your desktop, and then do a "Pull request" on Github, and I will push your changes into this server. I'll also give you a few months of membership depending on how tough the feature was to implement ;) </P>
