        <strong>Note: </strong>For users coming from the desktop versions of Aerolith -- these will be discontinued (taken offline) on or around July 1st of 2011. The code will still always be available, but I would like to transition people to this site. Version 0.9beta was used by a few people and also allowed users to save, load, etc lists. If it is essential for you to keep these lists please talk to me and I'll see what I can do. It's not easy migrating them over to this new architecture, but I will try if you really want these. Otherwise, please be sure to finish your lists by the migration date.
        </P>
        <P>Please register for Aerolith again on this website.</P>
        <P>
        Tip: this site works on netbooks too! Press F11 to put your browser in full-screen mode, and again to return to regular mode. </P>
