<P>Aerolith Flashcards was primarily written to be used with a poor or non-existent Internet connection, for example, for studying on public transportation / planes / walking down the street. </P>
<h4>How to use it</h4>
<ul>
    <li>Create a quiz by clicking New Quiz. This brings up probability search parameters (and maybe more in the future). As of right now, the biggest the quiz can be is 1000 alphagrams. This is the only step that requires having an Internet connection.</li>
    <li>The entire quiz is loaded on your computer or device. You can click Correct / Missed or go back cards. Clicking Missed will ask you the question again once you've gone through the entire set of cards. If you keep missing it the question will keep coming up at the end of the current set, much like in Wordwalls.</li>
    <li>The current state of the quiz is saved locally on your computer or device after each question. <strong>Only one quiz can be saved locally at a time.</strong> This is good for tablets where you can switch between different apps. For example, if you have Internet and you refresh the page, you will automatically continue from where you left off.</li>
    <li>You can back up your current local progress with the Aerolith server by clicking the Sync button at any time (when your Internet comes back, for example). This will make a copy remotely so that you can continue the quiz later on another device, for example, or allow you to quiz on only your first-missed questions.</li>
    <li>When you come back to this page later, you have a choice between continuing your local quiz or one of the remote quizzes. Note that loading a remote quiz will wipe out the progress on your local quiz -- the local quiz is replaced by the remote quiz. You will still have to click Sync to continue updating the remote quiz.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Local quizzes? Remote quizzes?</h4>
<P>This is explained above but if it is too much text here is the simple explanation. You can only have one local quiz, and it is <em>automatically</em> saved on your computer/device after each question. </P>

<P>You can back it up remotely so that you can quiz on only those words you missed on that quiz later, for example. This is done by clicking Sync whenever you want to back the quiz up. The remote quizzes show you all your quizzes saved on the Aerolith servers. These include the Wordwalls quizzes as well!</P>
