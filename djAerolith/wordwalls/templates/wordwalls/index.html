    <P>The "Week's Bingo Toughies" list gets updated every Tuesday at midnight PST (i.e. Tuesday 3AM EST). It will have the 50 toughest bingo alphagrams (7 and 8 letter words) of all of the previous week's challenges. The toughest bingos are the ones most commonly missed that week.</P>

In the future, you'll also be able to select multiplayer modes.</P>

        <P>First, please select a lexicon to view the saved lists for that lexicon.</P>
        <P>You can select a list that you have previously saved here. When you are playing a game, you have the option to save at the beginning or end of a round by clicking the Save button. Once you do this, the game will autosave after every round you play. When you save you will be prompted for a case-insensitive list name. These saved games show up in the list below. There are three options:</P>
        <P><i>Continue list progress (default)</i></P>
        <P>This will continue the list from where you last left off.</P>
 
        <P><i>Quiz only on first missed</i></P>
        <P>The very first time you go through a word list in its entirety, you will have a list of missed words. This quiz will consist only of those missed words. <i>If you select this option, and don't finish the 'first missed' list, if you want to finish it next time make sure to select 'continue list progress.'</i> You will get an error if you select this option before finishing a quiz once.</P>
        
        <P><i>Restart list</i></P>
        <P>In this option, you will restart the list from scratch. This eliminates progress on the list, so be careful! Your 'first' missed data will be lost.</P>
        <P>The table below that shows your word lists will show the name of the word list, and the last time this list was saved. There will also be an asterisk (*) after the date if you have already gone through the entire word list at least once.</P>
        <P><i>Delete list</i></P>
        <P>This option completely deletes the list; this cannot be undone! Make sure you want to delete your saved list before you choose this!</P>

    <P>Please select a file containing a list of words, one word per line. This app will quiz you on alphagrams, so for example,
    if your list contains DIATRONS but not INTRADOS, the app will still expect both words when it quizzes you for ADINORST. Make sure to select the correct lexicon.</P>
    <P>You can easily export a list from a program such as Zyzzyva; simply do a search, and right click on the search window, and click Save List. The list must contain no more than {{upload_list_limit}} words at this time, and the words must be between 2 and 15 letters long. This limit will probably be increased in the future once I figure out how to use Celery. </P>
    <P>Once you are in the table, you must click the Save button there if you wish to save the list. Then you can access the list later using the "Saved List" button at the top of this page.</P>
