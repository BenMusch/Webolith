This directory is blank in this git clone, but it should be populated with text and trie files. The text files I used came from the Zyzzyva lexicon downloads (OWL2.txt, etc.), and they are word/definition files. The trie files can be generated by my makedawg.py script.

In order to work with the Qt dbCreator project, the files should be named like
CSW07.txt
CSW07.trie
CSW07_r.trie
OWL2.txt
OWL2.trie
OWL2_r.trie
